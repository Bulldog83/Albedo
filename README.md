ARCHIVE
====

This is an archive of the bitbucket codebase for Albedo, developed by TheCodedOne and Falkreon (on a codebase originally by elucent) for a 1.13 forge snapshot.

This branch will not see any use beyond updating the README.md for further information. 

It exists solely for archival purposes. 1.13 Albedo was ported directly from the 1.12 version, but there were important fixes we wanted to backport, and for reasons outside of our control, we lost access to the repository for the mod, at the cost of an accurate git history.

This branch is our "Initial commit." We will be working backwards from here, so we can move forwards later.
